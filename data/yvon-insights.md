## Fireball Series

### FB 1500 & 1750 (from fireball-1500-1750-review)
- **FB 1500 v1**: "Not magic, only 10% better than 1350"
- **FB 1500 v2**: "Magic! Glides straight, goes fast, turns pretty well"
- **Cruise speed**: FB 1500 = 17-18 km/h, FB 1350 = 16 km/h
- **Pumping time**: FB 1500 nearly DOUBLES pumping time vs FB 1350
- **Setup**: Pair with Silly Short or Psycho Short fuse + Skinny 25
- **Mast rules**:
  - <85kg: Ultra Pro OK (careful with aggressive turns - can break hand)
  - >85kg: MUST use Fati mast + fuse for control
- **FB 1750**: "Opens the hour of pumping to everyone" — crossed Lake Châtel with headwind
  - Ultra Pro slides well but bends a lot at this size
  - Alu mast: Must stop every 15 min (heart rate too high)

### FB 1160 (from artv2-vs-fireball, foil-recap-2025)
- "One of my favorite summer foils for wave riding"
- Starts 10-15% harder than FB 1250
- Can start in inverted or normal water start (>16°C)
- "My favorite foil for riding - did almost all boats, downwind, super long downwind"

### FB 1070 (from artv2-vs-fireball)
- "Duck start almost every time with 2 steps"
- "Pleasure absolute in 15 knots+ with gusts to 20-25"
- "Turns so well and pumps great if water >16°C"
- Rock starts: 1 in 2 success rate

### Fireball vs ART v2 (from artv2-vs-fireball)
**Key finding: Fireballs have 25% MORE GLIDE than equivalent ART v2**

| Comparison | Turning | Glide | Duck Start |
|------------|---------|-------|------------|
| FB 1160 vs ART v2 1099 | ART 5-10% easier | FB +25% | ART 5% easier |
| FB 1070 vs ART v2 999 | Same | FB +25% | FB easier |
| FB 1000 vs ART v2 939 | ART 10-15% better | FB +25% | Both hard |

**Yvon's verdict**: "I prefer Fireballs in all cases - lake and ocean. ART v2 pushes too much water, too thick for pumping."

## ART v2 Series (from artv2-vs-fireball)

- **ART v2 1099**: Easier in choppy water (more chord), rail-to-rail 5-10% easier
- **ART v2 999**: Harder to start than FB 1070, rock starts 1 in 3
- **ART v2 939**: Turns 10-15% better than FB 1000, "very hard to duck start"
- **ART v2 879**: "ça tourne grave!" (turns like crazy) - excellent for tow/wing

**Best use**: Wing, towing, choppy conditions, carving
**Not ideal for**: Long-distance pumping (too much drag)

## PNG Series (from png1400v2-downwind-review, spitfire-1180)

### PNG 1400 V2
- **Setup tested**: Crazy Short 4-in-1 + Skinny 358-25 + Ultra Pro 80cm
- **Light wind downwind** (5-7 kts, 20-30cm bumps):
  - Key technique: "Accept to slow down to be pushed by bumps"
  - "PNG's low speed is REALLY low - can rest every 5-6 pumps"
  - "FB 1350 would be way too fast for these conditions"
- Goes faster than SF 1180
- Better for long pumping

### PNG/Spitfire Comparison
- **SF 1180**: "All-around wing" - turns better than PNG 1401
- **PNG 1401**: Goes faster, better for long pumping
- Honest take: "I don't know what to recommend - depends on swell speed"

---

## Tempo Series (from artv2-vs-fireball, fireball-1500-1750-review)

### Tempo 1090
- **"Nothing glides better in the world"**
- Like FB 1070 with 200cm² less area
- Turns better, glides better
- 15-20% less effort than FB 1070
- 5% harder to start than FB 1070

### CRITICAL: Tail/Fuselage Requirement
- **MUST use integrated tail fuselage** (not normal stab adapter)
- Normal adapter with Skinny stabs "adds crazy brake - not pleasant"
- Even Skinny Surf adds too much drag for pure pumping
- "Adriane said it's going to be fucking expensive"

---

## Mast Insights (from ultra-pro-mast)

### Ultra Pro 80cm
- Much stiffer than i-Modulus, especially torsion
- **10% faster glide** than i-Modulus
- **20% better** than 19mm alu mast
- "Acceleration is phenomenal"
- Enabled duck starting ART Pro 1121/1051/1001 (couldn't before)
- "Way faster than other riders with similar wings"

### Mast by Foil Size
- Small/medium wings: Ultra Pro ideal
- FB 1500 at <85kg: Ultra Pro OK
- FB 1500 at >85kg: Fati required
- FB 1750: Ultra Pro slides well but bends; Fati for control

---

## Stab Insights (from artv2-vs-fireball)

### Skinny vs Skinny Surf
- **Skinny normal**: Best for flat pumping
- **Skinny Surf 280** (95cm²): "Turns super soft, really pleasant for waves/downwind, but adds brake for pure pumping"
- Yvon's cut stab: Skinny 358-25 cut to 250-25

## General Technique Tips

### Light Wind Downwind (from png1400v2-downwind-review)
- Don't pump too much - you'll go too fast
- "Accept to slow down to be pushed by bumps"
- Use high-area, low-speed wings (PNG 1400 v2)
- Rest every 5-6 pumps on glide

### Duck Start Success (from artv2-vs-fireball)
- FB 1070: 2 steps = almost every time
- FB 1160: 10-15% harder than 1250
- ART v2 999: Harder than FB 1070
- Water temp matters: >16°C much easier

## Yvon's Personal Favorites

1. **Summer all-rounder**: FB 1160
2. **Strong wind (15+ kts)**: FB 1070
3. **Long distance/tiny bumps**: FB 1500, PNG 1400 v2
4. **Ultimate endurance**: FB 1750
5. **Pure performance**: Tempo 1090 (but expensive + needs special fuse)
