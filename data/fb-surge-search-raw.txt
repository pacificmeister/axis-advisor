Febrary 1a 210M

have been having fun over ast 2 weeks while on oldays down the South
(Coast. Neary 30 sessions on my new SURGE fol (890,960 and 10). Split reasonably eveny
oing Downwind, Winging and Foiive.

Lots of back-to-back comparisons in similar conditions to try and find out what works best

‘The results might surpis your

FAVOURITE DOWNHIND = 1010.

FAVOURITE WING = 950.

FAROURITE FOLLDRIVE = 890,

‘The biggest surprise forme was the 1010 on DOWNWINDS. | actualy compared it directly to
{e160 160 nas more glide but the 1010s way more fun. Both are super easy to get up but
top speed on the 1010 was sanificanty better (Got afew sub 2.10 which | would never get on

the 1160), And =the pitch stability increibe, You can rie super high wth full confidence you
won't breach

‘The 950 surprised me for WINGING. I thought | woul preter the 890 a have always used the
Ficebal 1000 for winging What i oved about the 950 was the stabil a ing out tough the
chops and the ease a bing (Disclosure: Lam a very average wingr aha}

For FOILORIV, | mainly svitched between 950 and 890. The B90 vas the pck ast jut ft 0
‘awesome on waves but sil ad plenty oft fora comfortable cruise back out, even into wind
fn chop,

I cou just have one SURGE t would be the 950
‘Te next obvious questions do you go then next smaller SURGE 830?

rm generally har to please with new fls but the lst 3 edtions trom AXIS Febal, Tempo
and Surge ~ have realy sled it

Congrats to Adrian Roper and the rest of the Als Team
