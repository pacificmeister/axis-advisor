Where other brands\u2019 high aspect foils are usually an unstable \u2018expert only\u2019 ride, we\u2019ve seen people jump on <strong>HPS</strong> and rip after just a few sessions mastering basics on higher lift foils.</p>\n<p>This is thanks to the beautifully balanced plan-shape and carefully considered down-turn and twist, that keeps this foil turning freely and handling predictably in all conditions.</p>\n<p>AXIS <strong>HPS</strong> is one of our most popular foil for winging for all levels riders once they have the basics down. A true industry benchmark. It\u2019s also making its mark in Downwind, Prone and SUP foiling for faster or more powerful waves. Its high-speed suitability also makes it a natural choice for windsurf and kite foiling.</p>\n<p>When you purchase\u00a0the AXIS carbon\u00a0front\u00a0wing\u00a0we include\u00a0an AXIS padded cover with zipper, in heather gray, and AXIS branding, for safer setup, transportation and storage.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>If you need screws for this wing, don't forget to add a<span>\u00a0</span><a title=\"AXIS Screwset\" href=\"https://axisfoils.com/search?q=screwset\" target=\"_blank\" data-mce-href=\"https://axisfoils.com/search?q=screwset\">screwset<span>\u00a0</span></a>to your order.\u00a0</em></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: start;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/2006/7439/files/HPS_Front-wing-tables_9d7297f1-2715-41b5-8768-5bddc1e781ff_2048x2048.jpg?v=1679172058\" style=\"float: none;\"></div>",

Its high-speed suitability also makes it a natural choice for windsurf and kite foiling.</p>\n<p>When you purchase\u00a0the AXIS carbon\u00a0front\u00a0wing\u00a0we include\u00a0an AXIS padded cover with zipper, in heather gray, and AXIS branding, for safer setup, transportation and storage.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>If you need screws for this wing, don't forget to add a<span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/search?q=screwset\" title=\"AXIS Screwset\" data-mce-href=\"https://axisfoils.com/search?q=screwset\" target=\"_blank\">screwset<span>\u00a0</span></a>to your order.\u00a0</em></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: start;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/2006/7439/files/HPS_Front-wing-tables_9d7297f1-2715-41b5-8768-5bddc1e781ff_2048x2048.jpg?v=1679172058\" style=\"float: none;\" data-mce-src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/2006/7439/files/HPS_Front-wing-tables_9d7297f1-2715-41b5-8768-5bddc1e781ff_2048x2048.jpg?v=1679172058\"></div>",

The Pump and Glide, PNG, 1310.</h3>\n<p>The strength and stiffness of our\u00a0AXIS <strong>Power Carbon</strong> and <strong>Power Carbon High Modulus Masts</strong> have opened up the potential for developing wings we could only dream about prior to our development and testing cycles for these new masts.</p>\n<p>Originally the <strong>PNG1310</strong> was designated the Ultimate Pumping Machine, however, in further testing, it proved so much more. The <strong>PNG1310</strong> is an amazing light wind/big guy front wing. Our team riders were amazed at its ability to get going in almost no wind and provided the\u00a0possibility to drop the wing at their side at will and simply pump upwind.</p>\n<p>What makes the <strong>PNG1310</strong> work isn't simply its span. We have\u00a0completely redesigned the <strong>PNG</strong> foil section for the PNG1310 with a focus on maximizing the\u00a0performance\u00a0and glide\u00a0of this massive front\u00a0wing.</p>\n<p>Performance that can best be tapped when used in conjunction with our new <strong>Power Carbon</strong> and <strong>Power Carbon\u00a0High Modulus</strong> masts. The AXIS <strong>PNG1310</strong> will amaze you as it turns the tiniest waves into a fun playground. This wing really resonated with our larger test\u00a0riders, but also with anyone in areas that aren't blessed with great surf and winds that rarely get above 8 knots.</p>\n<p>If you have ambitions of posting a pumping record, or like many of us just want to pull off a successful dock start this is the wing for you. The <strong>PNG1310</strong> is accessible to learners, and advanced riders alike. You can make the most out of the <strong>PNG1310</strong> when combined with the <strong>P</strong><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">ower Carbon</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\u00a0or the<strong>\u00a0</strong></span><strong>Power Carbon High Modulus</strong> masts.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/2006/7439/files/PNG_Front-wing-tables_c482df61-2d74-4adb-baaf-5320c183d0bc_2048x2048.jpg?v=1679174894\"></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

As the larger size of the Surf Performance wings, the 860 addresses the need of foil surfers for fast and loose turns on medium to small size waves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both the SP 860 and the SP 760 wing (the medium size wing of the SP collection), sit very well in the pocket. They don't blast you too far out, like some other wings do. These are true surf wings with good enough pumpability.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can throw the Surf Performance wings (660, 760, 860) around a lot more in the waves which we love so much. And due to their deep V design, they won't throw you too fast ahead of the wave. They are much easier to keep in the zone.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other than prone, the AXIS SP 860 carbon wing is a fantastic wave and cruise style kite foiling wing for lighter days. You can ride is as slow as you want, turns on a dime, and you can still push it on those faster downwinders. A perfect one wing kite setup which excels in the lightest of the wind.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SP 860 can also be high performance SUP wing for bigger days or lighter riders. And if it gets really windy, the SP 860 can be the surfiest Wing Surfing wing you have ever used.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Ideal for:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prone foiling medium / small waves</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kite Foiling freeride or waves in light or medium winds</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SUP foiling on bigger days</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wing surfing on bigger days</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wake foiling behind first wake\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/2006/7439/files/SP_Front-wing-tables_624f7dd0-a76e-4a8b-86f1-8b19fa8b4153_1024x1024.jpg?v=1679205702\"></p>",

          "description": "<p>The AXIS SP 760 Carbon front wing was designed with Surf Foiling in mind. As the medium size of the new Surf Performance wings, the 760 allows you to handle more juice in bigger and steeper conditions, while maintain control and loose turning. The 760 will be your choice when the waves are sucky and steep or close together with lots of link ups. Full skatepark mode.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both the 760 and 860 (the bigger wing of the surf family), sit very well in the pocket. They don't blast you too far out, like some other wings do. These are true surf wings with good pumpability.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can throw the Surf Performance wings (660, 760, 860) around a lot more in the waves which we love so much. And due to their deep V design, they won't throw you too fast ahead of the wave. They are much easier to keep in the zone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Other than prone, the AXIS SP 760 carbon wing is a fantastic wave and cruise style kite foiling wing. You can ride is as slow as you want, turns on a dime, and you can still push it on those faster downwinders. A perfect one wing kite setup.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ideal for:</span></strong></p>\n<p>Prone foiling bigger waves</p>\n<p>Tow-in foiling\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kite Foiling freeride or waves</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/2006/7439/files/SP_Front-wing-tables_624f7dd0-a76e-4a8b-86f1-8b19fa8b4153_1024x1024.jpg?v=1679205702\"></p>\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Its exceptionally low stall speed enables early take-off, while impressive glide, acceleration and controlled speed has allowed riders to connect bumps and maintain momentum in weak to moderate swell and wind conditions. Its intuitive pumping characteristics make it easy to recover from mistakes and navigate, even if you\u2019re not yet skilled in the art of finding the perfect line to link the bumps.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">When developing the AXIS <strong>PNG 1300v2</strong>, we were determined not to compromise on any of these outstanding features. We have succeeded in enhancing every detail and adding a few more you wouldn\u2019t imagine possible on a wing of this size.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The completely reimagined new <strong>PNG 1300v2</strong> now runs on our <strong>Black fuselage</strong> series (we recommend our latest <strong>Black Advance+</strong> range).</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The AXIS <strong>PNG 1300v2</strong> boasts low stall speeds, lower drag, better acceleration, better turning and a significantly higher top-end speed \u2013<span>\u00a0 </span>thanks to its finely tuned High Camber (High-lift) / Low-drag foil section. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The <strong>PNG 1300v2</strong> has reduced surface area (1632 sq cm) compared to the previous <strong>PNG 1300</strong> (1712 sq cm), but with the addition of its new foil section, it achieves the same capacity for early lift.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Vastly improved turning and a balanced lift distribution ensure a smooth, stable and comfortable ride, with predictable pitch control that makes navigating between bumps and pumping a breeze. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">This stability is crucial for light wind or novice downwinders, offering a more agile manoeuvrable experience than the original PNG 1300. We\u2019ve also extended its glide range, for unlocking new distances and manoeuvres when pumping flat water. You\u2019ll be amazed at how much further you can glide between pumps without losing speed or height.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">All these features make the AXIS <strong>PNG 1300v2</strong> an amazing addition for dock starters, of all levels. The lower drag, improved glide and reduced stall speed are fantastic for those who are progressing and have found that the bigger slow wings are just not much fun anymore.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Use the <strong>PNG 1300v2</strong> for SUP/Prone surfing when in smaller or lower energy surf. The amount of lift that the wing creates to get you moving and stay up on micro-waves is astounding.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">And let\u2019s not forget that the AXIS <strong>PNG 1300v2</strong> transforms what\u2019s possible for some of the lightest winds while winging.

These thin, skinny, super high-aspect foils demand the stiffest construction, allowing you to extract every ounce of performance out of the foil section from tip to tip.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Aspect Ratio (AR) 13 - super high aspect design - promotes reduced drag, allowing you to pump faster and with more forward projection than ever before, you can run with swells, go up and over easier and chase down bumps in front of you.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Our high-lift, low-drag Fireballs have incredible lift and carry, simply refusing to stall where other foils would have dropped out long ago. This unique lift and carry design allows you to get flying earlier, and with less effort. Dreaded touchdowns can now be pumped out of with relative ease.\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Overall Increased efficiency means advanced riders will be able to reduce foil area substantially, so you can conserve energy gain in speed and range while completing longer runs. You can choose a slightly reduced span, or ride approximately 200cm\u00b2 less surface area than previously with the <strong>Fireball</strong> range. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The <strong>Fireball\u2019s</strong> new foil section is very pitch stable which allows riders to drop down one or two skinny rear wing sizes. This further increases speed and reduces drag.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Fuselages:</strong> the <strong>Fireballs</strong> are best paired with the <strong>Short Advanced + fuselage</strong> for long distance downwind runs, or the<strong> Ultrashort Advanced + fuselage</strong> for shorter runs and a surfier feel.\u00a0</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><strong>Rear wings:</strong> the <strong>Fireballs</strong> are best paired with the smaller chord <strong>Skinny</strong> rears, with the <strong>359/40</strong> and <strong>358/35</strong> providing the minimal drag to reach their potential.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">For advanced riders we recommend pairings of the new <strong>Skinny</strong> <strong>358/30</strong> and <strong>358/25</strong>.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><span data-teams=\"true\">If you are 85kg (185lbs) or less, while we suggest to use the <a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/fatty-mast-range\"><strong>Fatty Mast</strong> and <strong>Fatty Fuselage</strong></a>, you could also consider the Pro Ultra High Modulus Mast or Power Carbon High Modulus Mast.

          "description": "<p class=\"p1\">The AXIS Surge isn\u2019t an evolution; it\u2019s a rebellion against mediocre foils.<br>We tore up the rulebook on surf foils. We refused to play by the old script. For too long, surf foils\u00a0demanded a sacrifice: carve or glide? But not both. We started from zero, rebuilt the geometry, and\u00a0delivered a wing that does both, without apology.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The AXIS Surge reinvents the category, shattering the old trade-offs that held surf foiling back.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>We\u2019re bringing the soul back.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The AXIS Surge reclaims the raw, connected feel of real surfing. The Surge reinvents the category, shattering the\u00a0old trade-offs that held surf foiling back.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Drop in and feel it ignite. Load up your back foot and feel the drive. Surge answers instantly,\u00a0knifing through the pocket with a shortboard attitude. The rail to rail transition is smooth and\u00a0predictable, lay it over and release your wingtips with confidence. Surge boasts effortless pumping,\u00a0green-lighting you to link sections and connect multiple waves like never before. It\u2019s fluid, locked-in, and alive under your feet.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The AXIS Surge\u2019s range is flat-out staggering, arming you with low-end torque that turns mushy, knee-high slop into a foil playground, letting you stall deep in the pocket, hit whitewater, and easily\u00a0pump back to the lineup for another lap. When you wind it up, you\u2019ve got explosive speed and\u00a0unshakable control giving you confidence to send it over the ledge on those outer reef freight trains.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Wing foilers, Para-wingers and kite foilers, level up with Surge.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is the freestyle and wave weapon you\u2019ve been begging for. Whether you\u2019re throwing it around\u00a0in freeride mode or chasing bombs on the wing with the throttle pinned, Surge unleashes buttery\u00a0smooth rail transitions, explosive pop and a locked-in feel that screams \u201cSEND IT!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Para-wingers, LET\u2019S GO!</b> Get ready to appreciate the huge range offered by the Surge, its\u00a0signature low end grunt allows early flight and easy planing, and top end efficiency enabling those\u00a0big upwind tacks and downwind voyages.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Pair it with our recently released <b><a title=\"AXIS Skinny Surf rear wings\" href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/skinny-surf\" target=\"_blank\">Surf Skinny Rears</a> </b>for the perfectly balanced blend of speed,\u00a0power and flow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This isn\u2019t evolution. This is a revolution in foil design. Surge doesn\u2019t follow the standard; it\u00a0obliterates it. Pure surf feel. Unmatched performance. No trade-offs.<br></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The AXIS Surge is available in the following sizes:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/2006/7439/files/Asset_3Surge_table_no1080.png?v=1764024158\"></p>\n<p><strong>Surge 780</strong> and <strong>740</strong> - shipping January 2026</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a rel=\"noopener\" title=\"AXIS SURGE 830 Carbon Hydrofoil wing\" href=\"https://axisfoils.com/products/axis-surge-830-carbon-hydrofoil-wing\" target=\"_blank\">740 (740mm x 112mm / 9.30 AR)</a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a title=\"AXIS SURGE 890 Carbon Hydrofoil wing\" href=\"https://axisfoils.com/products/axis-surge-890-carbon-hydrofoil-wing\">780 (780mm x 109mm / 9.48 AR)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a rel=\"noopener\" title=\"AXIS SURGE 830 Carbon Hydrofoil wing\" href=\"https://axisfoils.com/products/axis-surge-830-carbon-hydrofoil-wing\" target=\"_blank\">830 (830mm x 116mm / 9.48 AR)</a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a title=\"AXIS SURGE 890 Carbon Hydrofoil wing\" href=\"https://axisfoils.com/products/axis-surge-890-carbon-hydrofoil-wing\">890 (890mm x 125mm / 9.5 AR)</a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a title=\"AXIS SURGE 950 Carbon Hydrofoil wing\" href=\"https://axisfoils.com/products/axis-surge-950-carbon-hydrofoil-wing\">950 (950mm x 134mm / 9.52 AR)</a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/products/axis-surge-1010-carbon-hydrofoil-wing\" title=\"AXIS SURGE 1010 Carbon Hydrofoil wing\">1010 (1010mm x 141mm / 9.49 AR)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

The other Spitfires and ART PRO\u2019s are 2.5%) - the result:</p>\n<p>\u2022\u2060\u00a0 \u2060A very well-balanced foil,</p>\n<p>\u2022\u2060\u00a0 \u2060\u2060foils up easily and feels comfortable immediately,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022\u2060\u00a0 \u2060lift distribution is equal at speed and during acceleration,</p>\n<p>\u2022\u2060\u00a0 \u2060a quick and predictable recovery from breaches and tip-outs,</p>\n<p>\u2022\u2060\u00a0 \u2060\u2060turns very nicely and smoothly,</p>\n<p>\u2022\u2060\u00a0 \u2060\u2060has remarkable low-end and prolonged slower-paced glide.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The <strong>Spitfire 1180</strong> is a great wing for those getting into down-winding. It doesn\u2019t need to run as fast as the<strong>\u00a0ART PRO 1201</strong> or <strong>1401</strong> making it easy to stay on the bump. Turning and control are amazing for such a large wing, making downwind riding achievable for almost everyone.\u00a0 We feel it\u2019s exactly the right time for this foil, offering a less torturous in-road on the downwind journey.</p>\n<p>As a dock and pump wing, the <strong>Spitfire 1180</strong> is easy and forgiving to start, fun and surprisingly nimble to play with, and as such, is rapidly becoming a favourite among our dock starting and pump team riders.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Spitfire 1180</strong> is a light-wind wing foiling and small/weak wave SUP weapon. It has easy lift and is user-friendly, it shares the same easy predictable nature that has made the rest of the Spitfire range so popular in all disciplines, and now the bigger guys can enjoy them too.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the wake crew, the <strong>Spitfire 1180</strong> can ride any wake from the 1st to the 10th\u00a0and will be a go-to for the larger guys.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Through the development process, we put the </span><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Spitfire</strong><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"> through its paces.

Its turning and directional changes were seamless, allowing you to make sharper and more responsive movements with ease. A standout feature was how forgiving the foil was when the tips came out of the water \u2014 you couldn\u2019t even tell when it happened. This made it feel incredibly stable and confidence-boosting during my session.</span></p>\n<p><span>The <strong>AXIS </strong></span><strong>ART V2 1099</strong><span> strikes a fantastic balance between performance and ease of use. It\u2019s a great choice for foilers looking for a pump-friendly, stable ride that still offers sharp turning and responsive handling. Whether you\u2019re riding small bumps or working on your pumping technique, the </span><span>1099</span><span> delivers without demanding too much finesse, making it accessible for intermediate to advanced riders. The </span><strong>ART v2 1099</strong><span> is the answer for easy-to-use light winds winging, and small bumps SUP / DW / Parawing / Foil Drive and Prone. And if you are into wake foiling, it will give you great control roaming from the front to the back wake.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Comments from a team rider:</span></p>\n<p><span>\u201cThe </span><strong>ART v2</strong><span> is the style of wing that I was looking for.

          "description": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>For the lighter riders who want to push their limits either Winging, Prone or Kite foiling, the new</span><span> <strong>ART v2 819</strong>\u00a0</span><span>will be their go-to front wing.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Hot on the heels of the wildly popular </span><strong>ART V2</strong><span> Series </span><span>(879, 939, 999</span><span>), our team riders demanded a smaller, more dynamic addition to the lineup. Enter the </span><strong>ART V2 819</strong><span>\u2014the game-changer you\u2019ve been waiting for.</span></p>\n<p><span>Drawing inspiration from the best features of the smaller </span><a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/spitfire\"><strong>Spitfires</strong></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/axis-research-team-pro\"><strong>ART Pros</strong></a><span>, the </span><strong>ART V2 819</strong><span> strikes the ultimate balance between speed, glide, control, and manoeuvrability.</span></p>\n<p><span>With impressive low-end lift, this foil pops up on plane early and delivers a smooth, predictable ride. Perfect for riders pushing boundaries in freestyle and wave wing foiling, or progressing their skills in prone surf foiling, the </span><span>819</span><span> offers the high-performance edge you\u2019ve been craving.</span></p>\n<p><span>Built on the rock-solid foundation of the </span><strong>ART V2</strong><span> series, this foil combines stability with razor-sharp responsiveness, giving you the confidence to push harder, ride faster, and explore the limits of this rapidly evolving sport. As the smallest in the lineup, the </span><span>819</span><span> is your go-to for high-energy sessions and adrenaline-pumping conditions.</span></p>\n<p><span>Its elliptical mid-aspect shape and refined foil section ensure blistering top-end speed and effortless glide, making it a top choice for tow foiling and chasing down rolling open-ocean swells.</span></p>\n<p><span>In short, if you want the speed and glide of the </span><a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/axis-research-team-pro\"><strong>ART Pro</strong></a><span>, paired with the nimble agility of the smaller </span><span>Spitfire</span><span> wings, the </span><strong>ART V2 819</strong><span> is ready to elevate your ride. Are you?</span></p>\n<p><br>AXIS<strong> ART v2 </strong>is available in the following wingspan lengths:<strong>\u00a0</strong><br><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>1099 mm</strong> (area 1220cm2), AR 10.08<strong><br>999</strong>\u00a0<strong>mm</strong> (area 1038cm2), AR 9.90<br><strong>939</strong>\u00a0<strong>mm</strong> (area 900cm2), AR 10.0<br><strong>879</strong> <strong>mm</strong> (area 790cm2), AR 9.98<br><strong>819</strong> <strong>mm</strong> (area 647cm2), AR 9.98<br><br><strong>Notes from our design team:</strong><br>The AXIS <strong>ART v2</strong> is a foil that retains great glide and pump due to its span (like an <a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/axis-research-team-pro\"><strong>ART PRO</strong></a>), while the reduced area in the\u00a0tips allows us to retain the looser predictable turning characteristics of a much smaller wing. (similar to the <a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/spitfire\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Spitfire</strong></a>)<br>We achieved that by using a very tapered outline, we reduced the second moment of area for roll, and worked to\u00a0achieve a perfectly elliptical span-wise lift distribution.\u00a0<br>We have strategically reinforced the<strong> ART v2</strong> with military-grade Ultra High Modulus carbon in addition to our existing layups creating a stronger connection between the wing and the fuselage, which provides quicker response, better performance and additional strength.<br>The <strong>ART v2</strong> comes with a unique waterproof \u00a0X-Ply / Mylar material bag with\u00a0reinforcements, to keep your foil well-protected from impact, and elements.<br><br><strong>ART v2 </strong>is optimised for the <a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/black-advance-fuselage\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Black</strong><span> </span><strong>Advance+</strong></a> fuselage range and is ideally paired with either the<a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/skinny-rear-wings\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/skinny-rear-wings\">Skinny</a>\u00a0</strong>or smaller<a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/progressive-rear-wings\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://axisfoils.com/collections/progressive-rear-wings\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Progressive</a>\u00a0</strong>rear wing ranges.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0076/2006/7439/files/ARTv2-table_665cd809-d9eb-4a81-9d87-c1e5171d06fd.jpg?v=1735249974\"><br><!----></p>\n<p><!----></p>\n<!---->",

So while<span>\u00a0</span><strong>ART</strong><span>\u00a0</span>foils were a game-changer even on our existing masts, we knew there was still huge untapped potential to be realized.</span></p>\n<p>And so began a whole new development project, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited at the result. With a new power profile and carefully considered material selection and placement, AXIS<span>\u00a0</span><strong>Power Carbon</strong><span>\u00a0</span>delivers both superior stiffness with next-level strength.</p>\n<p>Opting for a one-piece design, we avoided the flow/drag and jointing issues associated with multi-part mast constructions.<br></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally and more importantly, testing proves that maximum loading is concentrated close to the baseplate and this is why the mast tapers thicker at this point to handle the loads. Any joins or two-piece construction at this high load area would destroy the integrity of the mast.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A revised\u00a0fuselage connection design maximizes the size of the\u00a0attachment point\u00a0to achieve a perfect fit to the fuselage reducing any chance of unwanted movement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result is a positive connected feel, direct drive, immediate feedback and ultimate control.

Compared to our Standard Black fuselage range, the <strong>Advance+</strong> provide a looser, faster transition from side-to-side. The sensation our testers liked it for is similar to the sensation of moving fins forward in the tracks on a surfboard, initiating turns becomes easier, which is great in the surf. There is a small trade-off, this ease of turning comes as at the expense of some tracking and speed stability. (So expect to have a small effect on upwind ability when winging and a need to adjust pumping technique slightly. If you are into ultra high speed big wave riding, you should consider the regular black fuselages instead).<br><br>With the mast set further forward on the fuselage, your baseplate position needs to be further forward in the boxes to position the wings in the same position as the normal Black fuselage<br><br>In an effort to reduce our cardboard footprint, these new Black\u00a0ADVANCE+ fuselages come\u00a0with our new custom fuselage protective covers, and no paper / cardboard boxes.\u00a0</p>",
