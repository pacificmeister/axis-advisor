Felt slippery and alive, found I couldn't quite grave dig as effectively as I can on the FB 1000 if I got too low or misjudged a wave while flagging but I think that was partially because I've become so lazy with the Fireball knowing I can pretty much get away with anything.

The Fireballs are made of ultra HM, which makes it dam stiff, unlike the 1st gen ARTs. You can feel the difference. The 880 though smaller glides better than the 899, goes faster than the 699. So I would say an upgrade of the 999 would be 1000. It's 200cm2 smaller but I believe it will be able to get up on foil as early as 999, glides better and go much faster.

The ART-V2 879 felt a little slower but I don't actually think it was looking at my GPS data, just more fluid and felt like had a lot of time to do maneuvers but definitely less glide, turns a little easier but not a big difference.

The lift to get up is really nice, especially for a wing with this span. Once flying, it's super fast with heaps of glide, and it just wants to keep going. For me this is a big one because I'm a heavier rider and I don't have endless leg power, but the Tempo felt really comfortable and manageable the whole time. I've only ridden it on a 90 Ultra High Modulus mast so far. It's obviously not a turning focused wing, and that's not what it's designed for, but I know everyone still wants to see how it handles. What really surprised me is just how friendly it feels overall. Compared to a Fireball in a similar size, the Tempo feels noticeably nicer and more forgiving.

I've now had 5 kitefoil sessions with the Flysurfer Sonic 5 (10 and 7.0) and the Supersonic 15, plus 2 wingfoil sessions on my lakes in South Africa. Usually I ride Fireballs and have owned all sizes. From the very first session the Tempo was a real blast for me. Finally getting rid of the additional drag. It actually rides even easier than my Fireball. It glides endlessly and starts surprisingly early. When you get a push forward by the kite or wing, it just accelerates with you. Pitch stability was surprisingly good, so I now only use the 35 Skinny. On the Fireball I usually needed the 45 Skinny or even the biggest Surf Skinny. I went straight from 43 km/h on my Fireball to 48 km/h on the Tempo 890 / Skinny 35 / Supersonic 15 \u2014 in only 10 knots of wind at the wind meter. Even in stronger wind I don't think I currently have the skills to go much faster. The turning radius is wider than the Fireball I think, but I didn't compare head-to-head yet. Because it's so effortless to gain speed, I can carve better with more leaning inward. Roll stability on the smallest 890 Tempo is lower with winging than I'm used to and prefer. With kitefoiling it was still easy to handle for me. Jumping is great and actually better than on my Fireball due to the extra speed I can generate. I couldn't test it with a Surf Skinny rear wing, as I forgot to order the rear-wing adapter. But it should help if you want tighter turns. For kitefoiling it turns tight enough for me. For wingfoiling and waves it could turn even tighter. Mounting and weight are really nice. It's a beauty how it is designed. I just love the speed and how easy they are to ride.",

      "text": "Thomas Boyce (95kg/210lbs, Central Canada, Season 4): You are on the exact same path as I am on. I started on the exact same AXIS foil as you: BSC 1060. I spent 2 seasons on it and got everything I could out of it. It certainly has too much lift beyond 20 kts and is pretty slow. Next I got a Spitfire 1100. Great foil for me for the next 2 seasons. Again, I got everything I could out of this foil. Now I am always hunting waves and swells and downwind runs. The Spitfire turns beautifully but is slowish, has mediocre glide and is not the best pumper. The new foil sections and shape that Adrian Roper has been working on for the Fireball, Tempo and Surge Foils has totally revolutionized the AXIS foil line. They all have some similar DNA and have a huge range (glide like crazy & have low stall speeds). They all have great speed too. In my opinion these 3 new foils are making a lot of the older AXIS foils less desirable. So if you can only afford one or 2 foils, I have a feeling that most Allround, real world conditions wingfoilers and Parawingers will be choosing the Fireballs or Surges. I have a Surge 1010 on order as my next foil. I think you should skip the ART V2, Spitfire and all the others and try to decide between the Surge 1010 and the Fireball 1070.",

It has improved the feel of every foil I've ridden it with. It combines the best of the turning and playfulness of the Progressive and the speed of the Skinny. 2) The new foils do need a newer board. They are so much faster, but take a bit more taxi speed to get going. Went to a now ancient Kalam E3 and it unlocked the takeoff of the modern foils. 3) I haven't tried the new Surge, so it's all just a thought... If the new Surge is as good as the Surf Skinny, I'd say it's worth the risk of going all in and making a huge one time jump right for the Surge. *If you're looking for budget, plenty of great deals on used Spitfires and V2 are on the FB page.",

First impressions after 1 sail. 15knots of wind although felt much lighter at times, flat bay conditions. Been winging with Art V2 819, 879 and 939 since they came out. Weigh 77kg. Would have gone out with ArtV2 879 in these conditions. Insanity easy to get on foil with crazy low stall speed. Suspect as good as the 939... Just cant believe how slow you could go and still recover. Turns awesome. Turns with confidence better than the 819. Was happy just turning on any bump for fun. Tip breaches as much as you like. Can sail up wind with tips breaching continuously. Foil so easy to use you have to breach tips to have fun. Pumps glides great. Will be a surfing delight. Very easy to use foil as it gets on foil easily, turns confidently and breaches gracefully. Would recommend it as a learning foil. The 320 Surf Skinny felt great. For winging at speed front foot force dropped off as speed went to maximum so maybe could use a bigger rear wing? Only negative is drag at top speed. Did not have a GPS but it felt slow and draggy at top speed. Guess this is the sacrifice for amazing low speed lift? Suspect V2 drag is much lower at high speed. Prefer the Art V2 for sailing up wind and the Surge for sailing down wind. Dont think the Surge will replace the Art V2 especially for high speed foiling on flat water.

It was an 18km ocean run in 15 to 20 knots. I would usually ride the Fireball 1070. Second run. Loved it. It's funny how a foil takes a run or two to click. This run was less wind (12 to 18 knots) but a faster underlying swell, and the Tempo was really good for these conditions - where glide matters the most. Turns well and handles quite wild conditions nicely. I think the main advantage for me is how free it makes your riding because of the glide and holding speed, so you can cut very well and kind of go wherever you want. It's good for up an overs too if you want to pump your brains out. So far I've got it to 2:16 and 34 kmhr max, but it likes about 2:20 to 2:30. Not dissimilar to Fireball 1070, but a touch faster with more glide. Using 35 stab and ultra 800 mast. I'm 86kgs. I'd use the Tempo 1090 is anything over 15 knots or if there is lighter wind and swell to ride. Basically, I'll be using the Tempo for all ocean downwind runs now.",

It's like it has two stall speeds, an initial lift and then it cruise stall speed if that makes any sense.

For me here in Perth, I go more for a Surge than a Fireball because when it's windy over 20 knots with the sea breeze, the bumps stack up and it's so much fun to surf. I like a surfy wing for shorter downwinds on a Parawing where I do upwind and downwind, usually 5 km runs that can end up 25-30 km in total. Doing that, a surfy wing just makes it more fun. I definitely go for a Fireball if I'm aiming for distance, like a over 30km run or so, where I just want speed, glide, and to cover ground efficiently. But for short runs after work, up and downwind, the Surge is way more playful. The Fireball or Tempo comes in when speed and distance are the priority.",

It has a really nice lift, comes up smoothly without shooting you out of the water, and has a very low stall speed. Every tip breach, which was always a bit tricky on the Spitfire, is easy to control on the Surge. Another big advantage over the Spitfire is the glide. With the Spitfire, you really compromise glide on downwinders. You have to actively work it to get it to glide. The Surge, on the other hand, glides naturally from bump to bump. You can even slow it down on a bump and surf it. For how I'm using it right now, I'd definitely prefer a Surge over a Spitfire. It's incredibly user-friendly, really easy to ride, and fun.",

But switched on once the wave hits the bank. Hence its a pure surf wing.\n\nTURNING: Fireball wins on long ride lines. Spitfire once the wave jacks up. The Fireball is still pretty surprising for surfing however. Art pro you have to initiate turn a split second and then let it turn, its not a surf wing; its a downwind or pump wing.\n\nGLIDE: Artpro for effortless glide. Like standing up soul position let it run on the swell bump. Better if wave offering nothing. Fireball for fluid friction free speed, better if the wave offering a little more. Spitfire for a surf wave to slow it all down.\n\nPUMP: Artpro for pure pumping\n\nLIFT: Artpro, but Fireball better if you don't want that lift going faster in wave face drops.

Easiest way to describe it is the 880 fireball on steroids.\n\nSPEED: First time using it and managed 31 knots top speed with 5s average at 30 knots and that certainly isn't its top capable speed. Even at this speed it was stable and wasn't too lifty. The acceleration is more remarkable - simply pulling in on the wing and you would suddenly jump to 25 knots.\n\nGLIDE: The glide is better than anything from any brand I've experienced. Gybes, tacks, 360 degree carves it will glide through the entire thing with speed and ease.\n\nGETTING UP: Getting up compared to the 880 fireball is harder, requires more technique (or power) and needs more speed before lifting fully out of water. Nonetheless it's still manageable even if you're slightly underpowered but will require skilful pumping.\n\nRESPONSIVENESS: Once you're up you will notice increased responsiveness, roll and pitch require more precision in stance. If you're capable of riding the 880 fireball then the tempo isn't too large of a progression step. However, if you're use to 10AR and below I do think it will be a challenge.\n\nWAVES: For waves it's a bizarre foil as initially you'd think it's too spanny and won't turn but it proved me wrong. Turns on a dime and can do reasonably tight cutbacks and turns without losing much lift (something the fireball struggles with).\n\nTURBULENCE: Handles turbulence very well, was riding in and out of boat propeller chop and didn't even notice it, no instability, no loss of lift. Also works pretty well as a wake foil.\n\nDOWNSIDES: No jumping (still a use for spitfires or art v2 for freestyle and heavy impact tricks). Looks and feels like a razor blade - don't want to hit it. Price with Ti link being quite pricey.\n\nVERDICT: If you're after an unparalleled glide and speed machine that's still capable of surfing and being used in most wing disciplines then it's worth it.",

Blown away at how easy it was to lift once the wind pressure kicked in and once foiling has a crazy low stall speed! As bizarre as it seems it felt like lower stall than the FB or V2! Agile and responsive and explosive acceleration... Michael covered it all pretty concisely and I have to concur! Just be aware of the knife like foils and be super careful in the shallows or when getting on as they are sharp!",

I could not notice any low end difference but definitely better high end. A little harder initially to pump to connect bumps but think it was technique and will get better. Today was prone. Waves were head high out back then reform through a 100m trough, gradually getting steeper before breaking again on the inside about waist to shoulder high. The 950 was perfect getting up on foil initially and riding the reform big bump but as it got steeper before breaking on the inside it got very hard to control due to excessive speed. It's probably too big a foil for me on steeper waist to chest high waves.",

I find it super stable when paired with a skinny 35 and a negative shim of 0.75\u00b0 (for better glide). I've also tested it quite a bit with a skinny 30 (even though this isn't recommended by Axis for wing). And then... the Fireball really comes alive, it's pretty crazy! When you're going full speed, you get a great whistling sound and you can really feel that the wing is free. On the downside, however, you get 'sucked' into a nose down position at high speed. Even when switching to a positive shim of +1\u00b0, the behavior remains similar, although the control is a little better/at the expense of glide, which makes the ride too unstable. Skinny 30 is not recommended for wings (risk of breakage). Wondering about Skinny surf stabs, particularly the 280/43, which in terms of surface area is right between the Skinny 30 and 35.",

The 300/45 I would only recommend if you wanted something to replace the 35 skinny.\n\nRegarding your sensation of nose down I would either get a board with more rocker as Adrian mentioned or use a smaller front foil. As it sounds like the foil may be becoming locked by using too large of foils for those conditions.

The chop made it very unstable so it was really hard to get going and when I was going it was very hard to control the foil. I have ridden the v2 999 for about a year and really like it. I tried a friends FB 1000 and it felt really close to the 999 so I opted for the 1070. I get a lot more glide and the 1070 will go very fast.",

We have achieved that goal and I am sure in time we will have other suitable wings designed to fit on it. No I do not think the join system is suitable for 1750 span pump wings. The existing black fuselage is great for this. Equally the upcoming surf wings fit beautifully on the black fuselage. The Ti Link was specifically for development of the Tempo and this particular design with very very thin wings will not work with a big fat chunky carbon fuselage or our black fuselage. The expanding joins inside the wings provide a rigid connection that I don't think the Omen style fuselage provides. The whole Ti Link and Tempo has taken years to develop and I believe the best, albeit, not the cheapest solution. I think you really need to play with the setup to appreciate what it is. It provides another level of connection and is very thin and sleek",

Dock start: Similar to Fireball 1070-1100 range. Pumping technique: Different from Fireball, more subtle movements needed, less flat pumping. Best use: 500m spot with good waves = SUPER wing. For long downwind (did 20km twice): Would be more comfortable on Fireball which has broader use case. Summary: Great for short punchy spots with good waves, for long DW stick with Fireball.",

I must admit after reading all the reviews I was a little underwhelmed. I haven't breached so many times in many a session, and found the pressure quite high which made it tiring. I've mostly been riding the HPS 930 and find it more controlled at speed while on the wave. They come up about the same. Top speed on the waves was around 16 knots, same as HPS, glide was a bit better but I feel like its a close call and HPS is more agile.

Mast all the way back for 999, 3cm forward for 930. For my preferences the clear winner is the 930, it is just so much more playful. Our waves are often in channels where wind opposite tide creates quite steep bumps that form and change quickly so the ability to flick around is key and that's where the HPS excels, it just turns on a dime and the pitch is super responsive. The glide on the ART is notable and average speed was a little higher (although top speed was on the HPS) but in pitch and yaw I found it so much less responsive. I can turn the ART pretty hard but it requires a lot more effort which adds up over a longer downwinder. I guess in open ocean swell where you have long rollers the ART would be superior due to speed and glide but for my local where a more aggressive style is needed I don't love it.",

I was really impressed with how fast it still goes. I hit over 34 km per hour on a surfy downwind run. It does feel a little harder or draggier to get the foil up, but once you are riding it feels super solid. There is definitely a bit more drag compared to the Ultra High Modulus Mast. With the UHM you can fly higher and it accelerates a lot quicker. The Fatty Mast is slower and you need to pump it more. You cannot really overtake bumps with it. But to be honest I actually like that. You can stay on a bump or a swirl really nicely and just keep surfing it. You are not overrunning it or going too fast. It gives you a different kind of downwind feeling because you can slow it down easily and really surf the energy. The only downside is if you miss a bump or want to overtake one, that is something the Fatty Mast does not really allow. The UHM can do that, no problem. But otherwise I am really impressed with how the Fatty gear works, especially for heavier riders like me at 115kg. I am loving it.",

For Bay Area with what you want to do and not really ocean breaking wave riding I would seriously consider the FB for the glide and good handling for such a HA wing. the 1070 for 20 kts is real nice for us big guys I really like it but need 17 kts so that's why I have the 1250 for lighter days and parawing. but for in the bay might be a better choice FB series, just don't think your going to get the speed/glide out of the surge compared to the FB that comes in handy in bay relatively flatter conditions.",

The Surge just covers everything the V2 does, but for my style it does it better. You still get the speed and efficiency, but with the added surf-style feel and way more freedom to turn. A lot of my mates have ended up replacing their V2s with a Surge as well, so that kind of says it all. Some people still love their V2s, and that's totally fine, but for my riding the Surge does the whole job and lets you actually surf the foil too. It's definitely not a Fireball with that full-on glide. It just comes down to what you want to do \u2014 pure glide or more surf-style downwinding and prone surf etc",
